VEGGIES FOR LIFE
-----------------


Theme:
You are a farmer in a dystopian society where your life is time and time is currency. If you run out of time you run out of life.
You struggle to survive by raising good crops that make you more time. Or you might grow shitty crops and die

Concept:
- You have some time as money with you
Every level you get some seeds of which you can choose one to sow.
Each seed can grow in X amt of time. The quality of growth depends of the weather, seed affinity etc.
You also have to figure in the amt of time you have left. If you aren't able to sell the crops before you run out of time you die.

A well chosen crop will bring in more "money" while a badly chosen crop will be your end
